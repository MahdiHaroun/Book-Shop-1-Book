    <li>Name : Meditations by Marcus Aurelius</li>
    <li>Price: 15$ </li>
    <li>description:</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="color: rgb(0, 195, 13); font-size: large; font-weight: bolder;">If you’re looking for daily comfort, motivation, and wisdom, this is one of the best books you’ll ever pick up. I don’t see why anyone shouldn’t read this. The advice is as sound as when Marcus gave it to himself 2,000 years ago, and the book will benefit you in tough as well as glorious times. Plus, it might even inspire you to start journaling yourself!</p>

    <li>Name : Man’s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl
    </li>
    <li>Price: 5$ </li>
    <li>description:</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="color: rgb(208, 255, 0); font-size: large; font-weight: bolder;">There are few holes this book couldn’t make you crawl back out from. Beyond inspiring you to rethink meaning and find it wherever you go, however, it will also instill tremendous respect in you for those who’ve come before us. This book is enlightening on both a personal and a historical level, and I think almost anyone would benefit from reading it.</p>

  <ul style="color : rgb(139, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
    <li>Name : The Daily Stoic by Ryan Holiday</li>
    <li>Price: 8$ </li>
    <li>description:</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size: large; font-weight:bolder;">If you struggle with reading non-fiction at a pace that makes you feel good about your progress, this is the book for you. It’s also one of my all-time favorites. I read it every year for five years in a row. A page a day is so easy to read, you can’t not do it. As a result, you’ll gain a great overview of Stoicism and implement plenty of its tenets in your life.</p>
