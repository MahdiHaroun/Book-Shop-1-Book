  <p style="color: rgb(0, 12, 88); font-size: large; font-weight: bolder;">This has been described as: “A legendary modernist epic of visual thinking from the founder of iconology, tracing the migration of symbols through art, history and cosmology -reconstructed and accessible for the first time.” From 1925 until his death in 1929, the great German art theorist and cultural scholar Aby Warburg created an unprecedented project that he called the Mnemosyne Atlas. It was a series of 63 large, themed panels, featuring groups of related visual motifs across time and cultures (postcards, maps, adverts, reproductions of artworks) that encapsulated the migration of symbols from antiquity to the present. His intention was to reveal that certain gestures and icons repeated themselves across history, constituting what he called a “pathos formula”, namely an enduring emotional metaphor. Warburg had the panels photographed, with the view to publishing a single volume.</p>

    <li>Name :Abstract Art: A Global History by Pepe Karmel
    </li>
    <li>Price: 70$ </li>
    <li>description:</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: large; font-weight: bolder;">This splendid book will serve as a challenge to the history of abstraction; it is also a superb book to dip into and enjoy, an essential addition to the established art library and a perfect gift for art students. Pepe Karmel debunks the Eurocentric and US history of abstraction. He asserts there is no such thing as pure form; that the true history of abstract art is not merely the narrative of formal innovations but that it offers, “a series of responses to social, to political and cultural change”. Breaking from conventional history, Karmel includes female artists (“Beatriz Milhazes has no respect for the rules of modernism”), artists of colour (Sudanese artist Ibrahim El-Salahi painted a calligraphic Prayer in 1960) and artists from diverse regions and cultures</p>
