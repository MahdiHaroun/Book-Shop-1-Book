    <li>Name : The Stars My Destination, by Alfred Bester (1957)</li>
    <li>Price: 10$ </li>
    <li>description:</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="color: rgb(17, 176, 163); font-size: large; font-weight: bolder;">This landmark novel begins with a simple proposition – what if humans could teleport? – and sprawls into a tale of rebirth and vengeance that winds across the Solar System: The Count of Monte Cristo for the interstellar age. First published as Tiger! Tiger! in the UK, named after the William Blake poem, it follows Gully Foyle – a violent, uneducated brute who spends six months marooned in deep space, and the rest of the book seeking retribution for it.</p>

    <li>Name : Solaris, by Stanislaw Lem (1961)</li>
    <li>Price: 15$ </li>
    <li>description:</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="color: rgb(14, 152, 143); font-size: large; font-weight: bolder;">If you think you know Solaris from the 2002 Steven Soderbergh film, the original book may come as a bit of a surprise. Written by Polish writer Stanislaw Lem in 1961, this short novel is heavier on philosophy than plot. It follows a team of humans on a space station who are trying to understand the mysterious living ocean on the planet Solaris, with little success – their research is limited to lengthy descriptions that paint a vibrant picture of the alien planet but fail to elucidate how it works. As they poke and prod, Solaris ends up exposing more about them than it does about itself, with the book demonstrating the futility of humans trying to comprehend something not of their world.</p>

    <li>Name : Dune, by Frank Herbert (1965)</li>
    <li>Price: 9$ </li>
    <li>description:</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="color: rgb(28, 156, 143);font-size: large; font-weight:bolder;">In 2012, WIRED US readers voted Dune the best science-fiction novel of all time. It’s also the best-selling of all time, and has inspired a mammoth universe, including 18 books set over 34,000 years and a terrible 1984 movie adaptation by David Lynch, his worst film by far. A very different effort was released in 2021, directed by Denis Villeneuve. The series is set 20,000 years in the future in galaxies stuck in the feudal ages, where computers are banned for religious reasons and noble families rule whole planets. We focus on the planet Arrakis, which holds a material used as a currency throughout the Universe for its rarity and mind-enhancing powers. Lots of giant sandworms, too.</p>
